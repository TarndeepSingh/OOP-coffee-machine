# Coffee Machine (OOP) ☕

An object-oriented simulation of a coffee machine built in Python.
This project demonstrates how a real-world system can be modeled
using classes with clear responsibilities.

## Features
- Menu-driven drink selection
- Resource management using a dedicated CoffeeMaker class
- Payment handling using a MoneyMachine class
- Modular, extensible design
- Clear separation of concerns

## Object-Oriented Design
- `Menu` – manages available drinks
- `MenuItem` – represents a single drink
- `CoffeeMaker` – manages resources and coffee preparation
- `MoneyMachine` – handles payments and profit tracking

## Concepts Practiced
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation and responsibility separation
- Class interaction
- Real-world system modeling

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
